= Administration Guide

This guide will help you get the most out of your HubPress blog. It will teach you how to configure the various features of your blog so you can make it your own.

If you don't care too much about customising your blog at this stage, and just want to start writing, review the helpful info in the link:Writers_Guide.adoc[Writer's Guide] to get you writing blog posts the right way.

NOTE: You do not need any special systems administrtion knowledge to use HubPress. We've split out the Administration information so the README remains small in size.

== About the Administration Console

The HubPress Administration Console is available at */hubpress*:

* `https://[username].github.io/hubpress/` for GitHub Hosted blogs, or
* `https://[username].github.io/[repositoryName]/hubpress/` for Domain Hosted blogs.
* `https://[cname_domain]/hubpress` for custom domain-hosted (CNAME) blogs.

NOTE: If you are using a CNAME, you might need to access your Administration console using the `https://<username>.github.io` address pattern initially, so your CNAME redirect will work.

== Log Into the Administration Console

image:http://hubpress.io/img/login.png[Install complete,300]

Enter your GitHub credentials to log into HubPress Admin.

Once you authenticate, a personal token is created for future calls from HubPress to the GitHub API.

This is synchronized across all sessions of HubPress.
If you open the Administration Console on your PC and then your Tablet, the token is applicable to all devices.

== Settings Page

You can configure basic blog settings (such as CNAME and Pagination) and social media accounts you want to connect to your blog.

Each settings group is separated into tabs, to logically group the settings.

=== Meta

This tab contains basic information configured in the `/hubpress/config.json` file.

The following fields are configurable:

Git CNAME::
    Lets you specify a custom domain name for your blog.
    See https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/[Setting Up A Custom Domain] for instructions about setting up a CNAME for your blog.
Live Preview Render Delay::
    Controls how long the live render takes to refresh, in milliseconds.
    For fast typists, setting this field to a value over `2000` (two seconds) will result in a smoother editing experience because the live preview will not be regenerated so frequently.
    Setting this value below `2000` will result in the live preview refreshing faster, but may result in some visible cursor delay when typing.

=== Site

==== Title and Description

The *Title* and *Description* fields allow you to give your blog a name, and tell visitors what they can expect from your blog posts.

==== Logo and Cover Image

The *Logo* and *Cover Image* fields allow you to specify art asset that will be used on each page of your blog:

* An HTML link to an image hosting service. For example gravatar, for your avatar.
* A link to an image committed to the /images directory of your blog repository.

IMPORTANT: The format you specify in these fields is important for repository-hosted images.

You must use the pattern `/images/<filename>` so the static site generator can create the image paths to each sub-page of your blog.
Failing to specify the leading forward-slash will mean the absolute path generated in the HTML pages will break.
You'll know this has happened when Page 2 of your blog onwards does not have any cover or logo images.

See the link:Writers_Guide.adoc#Adding_Images[Adding Images] section in the Writer's Guide for more information about using Images.

==== Theme

The *Theme* is selectable from the list of themes stored in the `/themes` directory.

This field is a free-text field, but you need to specify the theme according to the folder name.
The current folder names are:

* casper
* ghostium
* ichi
* roon
* saga
* uno
* uno-zen

.New in 0.5.0
NOTE: Theme names have all been changed to lowercase for consistency.
If you find your theme is not loading, check the site settings and adjust the names accordingly.

==== Google Analytics

The *Google Analytics* field takes the Google Analytics Tracking ID of your site. For example `UA-1234567-1`.

==== Disqus Shortname

The *Disqus shortname* field takes your Disqus user name that you specified when registering a new site for Disqus.

Only the shortname is required, not a link to your profile page.

If you have not enabled Disqus for your site, create a site profile at https://disqus.com/admin/create/ with the name of your blog to get started.

=== Social Network

All fields in this group require full URLs to your public profile page.
The way these values are rendered on your blog depends on the theme selected.

== Managing Posts

When you first start HubPress, the *Posts* view is empty.
As you create blog posts, the page populates with the list of posts on the left, and a live preview of the blog post itself on the right.

See the link:Writers_Guide.adoc[Writer's Guide] for tips about creating posts successfully with HubPress.

== Update HubPress

Because HubPress is hosted on GitHub, you can update by pulling down the latest changes from the HubPress master repository.

If you're new to GitHub, the repository you forked the project from is referred to as `Upstream`.

You update HubPress by creating a Pull Request (PR) against the hubpress.io upstream repository.

With cross compare fork feature of github, you can always use updated HubPress.

. Click Compare button in your HubPress repository
+
image::maintain_the_latest_hubpress_01.png[click compare button]
+
. Change base fork to your repository and set the proper branch. I use the master branch here. But if you want to use another branch, you can change it. For example, it would be gh-pages branch.
+
image::maintain_the_latest_hubpress_02.png[set base fork]
+
. Select compare across forks.
+
image::maintain_the_latest_hubpress_03.png[compare across forks]
+
. Change head fork to HubPress/hubpress.io repository.
+
image::maintain_the_latest_hubpress_04.png[set head fork]
+

Now, you can use the most recent HubPress version included bug fixed, new features.

== Use HubPress with Multiple Users

You can _technically_ use the same HubPress instance with multiple authors, but it requires some trust from the other users granted access to your blog.

There are some points to consider before opening up your blog instance to other contributiors.

Attribution::
    There is no way to attribute a blog user to individual posts at this stage, unless you perhaps use a :hp-tags: category for the name of each contributor (a crude work-around at best).
Global User Name::
    Blog posts are attributed to the primary GitHub User who configures the Settings page.
    If someone you invite to co-author your blog saves changes to the Settings page, *all* blog posts will have that author as the person who wrote blog posts in your HubPress instance.

If you have a close, trusted team of bloggers who just want to write posts, then you can use HubPress together.

Understand that HubPress is really only suited to single bloggers, and does not offer any GitHub authentication intelligence for blogging teams.
