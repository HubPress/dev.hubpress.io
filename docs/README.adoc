== HubPress Documentation

=== New Location

The docs have been migrated to the https://hubpress.gitbooks.io/hubpress-knowledgebase/content/[HubPress Knowledgebase] (KBase).

Type your question into the search field, and you will see matches to your question display as you type.
You can also scroll down the categories and look for information by groups.

If you can't find the information you need, https://www.gitbook.com/book/hubpress/hubpress-knowledgebase/discussions[create a discussion] and the HubPress community will help you find what you need, or get an Article created so others can benefit from your observations.

Read on to find out why the docs have moved to GitBook, and how you can contribute.

=== The Past

HubPress documentation was originally static AsciiDoc files, which were stored in each blogger's forked repository.
This was fine in the early days of HubPress, but it became obvious from repeated documentation bugs that this approach was not meeting the needs of a growing HubPress Blog base.

Bloggers were finding it difficult to find answers to common questions scattered througout the files, and action needed to be taken to improve the User Experience.

=== The Present

The https://hubpress.gitbooks.io/hubpress-knowledgebase/content/[HubPress Knowledgebase] (KBase) is the new place to learn how to use HubPress.

The KBase is hosted on https://GitBook.com, and uses the `theme-faq` template to provision the Knowledgebase.
The source is still AsciiDoc files, but the structure has changed.

Content in the KBase is designed to be searchable, and is presented as a mixture of a narrative flow (by the prescribed order of the articles on the home page) and stand-alone reference articles.
Where it makes sense, articles contain links to related articles at the bottom of each post.
The vision https://github.com/jaredmorgs[Jared] has for the KBase is that it becomes a scalable resource that not only meets our User's needs, but also meets the basic requirements of http://everypageispageone.com/[Every Page is Page One].

=== The Future

Great documentation is a collaborative effort, and we need your help.

If you would like to contribute to the documentation (whatever the language), request to be added to the GitBook project by mentioning @jaredmorgs on https://hubbpressio.slack.com[HubPress Slack].

Jared can introduce new writers to the way GitBook works.

The plan is to host the GitBook documentation in GitHub itself, so that anyone can make casual, minor changes to the documentation through the regular GitHub Pull Request system.

== Customising and Using Your Blog Site

Once you have logged on as instructed in the HubPress Knowledgebase, you can customise your Blog site by completing the following tasks:

* https://hubpress.gitbooks.io/hubpress-knowledgebase/content/tabs/about_social_tab.html[adding social network information],
